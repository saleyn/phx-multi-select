# Phoenix LiveView MultiSelect Component

This project implements an Elixir Phoenix LiveView component that has a capability
of selecting multiple check-boxed items from a list.

![Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/272543/214661918-110505f2-e796-40e3-a1ee-47178cb0daba.png)

The component supports the following options:

- Selection of multiple items from the given list of options
- Limit the max number of selected items
- Ability to either wrap the selected tags in the main div of the component or
  collapse them in a single tag
- Ability to search in the list of options on the client side or on the server
  side
- Support of light/dark color themes
- Support of AlpineJS and LiveView.JS javascript libraries

Here's a sample [video](https://youtu.be/TfcgxACXWiM) illustrating what this component looks like in action.

This component is inspired by [this article](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/liveview-multi-select) but is a complete rewrite with added features for
usability.

## Installation

Include the project in the `mix.exs` as a dependency:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    {:phoenix_multi_select, "~> 0.1"},
    ...
  ]
```

Run `mix deps.get`, and `mix multi_select.install`. This will modify the following
files:

- `assets/tailwind.config.js` - to add the necessary color alias, and search path
- `assets/package.json` - to add the tailwind scrollbar customization
- `assets/js/hooks/multi-select-hook.js` - copied from the multi_select source
- `assets/js/hooks/index.js` - add the MultiSelectHook

Install the javascript packages with your preferred package manager e.g `cd assets && npm install` or `cd assets && yarn install`

If the AlpineJS support is requested (`:use_alpinejs` options), the `root.html.heex`
and `app.js` will be checked for installation of AlpineJS.

## Usage

In your `assets/js/app.js` be sure to add the `hooks` entry with the live socket
initialization:

```javascript
import hooks from "./hooks" // <--- add this line
...
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
  params: { _csrf_token: csrfToken },
  hooks: hooks, // <--- add this line
});
```

In your project locate this file `{{your_project}}_web.ex`, and add:

```elixir
  defp html_helpers do
    quote do
      ...
      import Phoenix.LiveView.Components.MultiSelect   ## <--- add this line
      ...
    end
  end
```

Now in the `*.html.heex` templates you can use the `multi_select` LiveView
component like this:

```elixir
<.multi_select
  id="some-id"
  options={[
    %{id: 1, label: "Option1"},
    %{id: 2, label: "Option2"},
    ...
  ]}
/>
```

For list of the available component's options see
`Phoenix.LiveView.Components.MultiSelect.multi_select/1`

## Customization (`config.exs` file)

- In order to add a custom class name to the `multi_select` component that will be
  added to the top-most `div` element, and that it can be customized in your CSS files,
  add the following configuration option:

```elixir
config :phoenix_multi_select,
  class_prefix: "some-class-name"
```

- You can also override the built-in CSS classes for every aspect of the
  component's presentation by defining a custom callback module, that implements
  a `apply_css/3` function, which will be called to get a string of CSS classes
  for every part of the component. Here is an example where the `primary` color
  is replaced by `pink`. The first argument to the `apply_css/3` function is
  the ID of the element that needs to apply customization. This way if the page
  has multiple multi selects, they can be styled differently. See the `@css`
  attribute in
  [multi_select.ex](https://github.com/saleyn/phx-multi-select/blob/main/lib/multi_select.ex#L125)
  for the list of permissible `tag` values passed to the `apply_css/3` function.

```elixir
config :phoenix_multi_select,
  class_module: MyModule
```

Here is an example of implementation of such a module:

```elixir
my_module.ex:
=============
defmodule MyModule do
  def apply_css(_id, _tag, def_css_classes), do:
    String.replace(def_css_classes, "primary", "pink")
end
```

- In order to enable AlpineJS support instead of LiveView.JS, set this config option:

```elixir
config :phoenix_multi_select,
  use_alpinejs: true
```

## Demo

The demo project is located in the `examples/` directory, and can be compiled
and run with:

```bash
cd examples
make
make run
```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
